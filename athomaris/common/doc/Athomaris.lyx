Basic Setup
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Requirements: you need Linux, Apache with 
\family typewriter
mod_php5
\family default
 and some of the supported databases (currently only MySQL, but a Sybase
 driver and other drivers are planned).
 If you want to use the business process execution engine, you also need
 to install and enable the 
\family typewriter
pcntl
\family default
 extension module of PHP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copy the sources of the Athomaris PHP Library to the document root of your
 webserver.
 In the following, we will assume that this is 
\family typewriter
/www
\family default
.
 If you use another place, you have to adapt the following examples accordingly.
 So it looks like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
cd /www; sudo tar xzpf athomaris.tar.gz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This creates a directory 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/
\family default
.
 It is imporant to do this as 
\family typewriter
root
\family default
, because there are directories owned by different users
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If it went wrong, or if you got the sources via 
\family typewriter
svn
\family default
, you can the fix the permissions as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
cd /www/athomaris; chmod 755 */compiled; sudo chown -R wwwrun */compiled/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Afterwards, configure Apache the following way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<Directory "/www/athomaris">
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    AllowOverride AuthConfig
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    AuthName "The Athomaris PHP Library"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    AuthBasicProvider file anon
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    AuthUserFile /dev/null
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Require valid-user
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    AuthBasicAuthoritative Off
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Anonymous_NoUserID off
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Anonymous *
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Order allow,deny
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    Allow from all
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
</Directory>
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Alias /demo_basic "/www/athomaris/demo_basic"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Alias /demo_advanced "/www/athomaris/demo_advanced"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Alias /demo_business "/www/athomaris/demo_business"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure the 
\family typewriter
authn_anon
\family default
 module of Apache is loaded.
 Many Linux distributions have it disabled by default.
 Typically, you need to add it to 
\family typewriter
/etc/sysconfig/apache2
\family default
 or to some file in 
\family typewriter
/etc/apache2/sysconfig.d/
\family default
 or to another place within 
\family typewriter
/etc/apache2/
\family default
 (distribution specific).
 Afterwards don't forget to restart Apache!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important:
\series default
 if you communicate over 
\series bold
untrusted networks
\series default
, is is 
\emph on
highly recommended
\emph default
 to use 
\family typewriter
\series bold
https
\family default
\series default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
http
\family default
.
 Otherwise an attacker will be able to watch your passwords from the basic
 HTTP authentification.
 You will need an 
\family typewriter
SSL
\family default
 certificate for 
\family typewriter
https
\family default
.
 Creating or obtaining certificates and configuring Apache for 
\family typewriter
https
\family default
 is beyond the scope of this paper.
 Please consult the Apache documentation and various web resources for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further potential pitfalls: if you want to process large data fields such
 as TEXT or BLOBs, you probably have to increase the 
\emph on
memory limits
\emph default
 of PHP.
 Some distributions use rather small defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Demo Projects
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Demo-Projects"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Provided you have a local MySQL installation running, you can immediately
 use the demo projects 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/demo_basic/
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/demo_advanced/
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/demo_business/
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inspect the files in the demo project.
 There are not many, and they are rather small and simple.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
config.php
\family default
 in each of the demo directories describes the connections to database servers
 and their drivers.
 The others mostly include generic code from the 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/common/
\family default
 subdirectory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database schema in 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/demo_basic/schema/schema01.php
\family default
 is the most central place you will have to deal with.
 Its content should be rather self-explanatory for PHP programmers.
 Details on it will be provided later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use a web browser such as Firefox or Konqueror to open the following URL:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/demo_basic/create_schema.php
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your Apache setup is correct, your browser will ask you for a username
 and a password (using the basic authentification mechanism of the HTTP
 protocol).
 Type in 
\family typewriter
root
\family default
 and the appropriate root password for your MySQL server.
 Note that you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 have already set a root password for MySQL (which is not the same as the
 root password of the operating system), and you normally really 
\emph on
need
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Exception: you are a database expert who knows how to grant appropriate
 privileges to other users.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 root access in order to be able to create a new database
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some Linux distros deliver MySQL without any root password.
 In such a case Athomaris will not work, because passwords are mandatory.
 You may use the following command for setting an initial password:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mysqladmin -u root password 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

secret
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If you have trouble with that, consult the MySQL and the Apache documentation,
 inspect the logfiles, and probably turn on debugging of some of the components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After successfully gaining root access, you will see a 
\emph on
preview
\emph default
 screen with MySQL commands.
 Look at them.
 If you want to actually execute these commands, click on the button named
 
\family typewriter
demo_advanced
\family default
.
 If all is ok, you will be notified that the database has been created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you like, you may check the database by hand, for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mysql -p -u root demo_basic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
show tables;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
describe foos;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can see that the schema definition from 
\family typewriter
schema/schema01.php
\family default
 has been applied pretty straightforward.
 However, some additional columns have been 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 created.
 Some of them have to do with 
\emph on
temporal databases
\emph default
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Temporal-tables"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us change the schema, by adding a new column.
 Copy the file 
\family typewriter
schema/schema01.php
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
schema/schema02.php
\family default
 without altering the old version s
\family typewriter
chema01.php
\family default
, and afterwards edit the new version 
\family typewriter
schema02.php
\family default
 in the following way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copy the definition of 
\family typewriter
foo_name 
\family default
including its sub-structure, and rename it to 
\family typewriter
foo_somethingelse
\family default
.
 You may change the 
\family typewriter
TYPE
\family default
 field to a different type, such as 
\family typewriter
varchar(50)
\family default
, or change the 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT
\family default
 value to something you like.
 A list of available types will be provided later.
 Note that you must always provide a 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT
\family default
 value when you want to create a 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 column in the database.
 You can also change the 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT
\family default
 of an existing column, or even remove a column (but please don't remove
 columns mentioned in UNIQUE keys - they are vital).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After modification of 
\family typewriter
schema02.php
\family default
, just open the URL for 
\family typewriter
create_schema.php
\family default
 again.
 Now you will see different SQL statements, in particular 
\family typewriter
alter table
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
drop column
\family default
 statements, depending on what you have changed between 
\family typewriter
schema01.php
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
schema02.php
\family default
.
 When executed, these statements will update the database to the new version
 of the schema.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
What's the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

big clue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with that? When using advanced features such as 
\family typewriter
profiles
\family default
 (see 
\family typewriter
demo_advanced
\family default
) or when implicitly adding further tables (e.g.
 for the business process engine, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Business-Process-Engine"

\end_inset

), these tables will be automatically 
\emph on
kept consistent
\emph default
 with the global schema 
\begin_inset Formula $\Longrightarrow$
\end_inset

 aka 
\series bold
schema management
\series default
.
 In future Athomaris releases, we want to provide web interfaces for schema
 management, then you no longer will need to deal with PHP variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the database, open the following URL:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/demo_basic/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can enter new tuples into the database, browse the data in various orders
 and selections, update and delete the data as you like.
 It should be rather self-explanatory what you can do.
 Just try it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you like, you may change the schema again using the name 
\family typewriter
schema03.php
\family default
, after you already have populated your tables with data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to customize the user interface, look at the file 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/common/tpl/generic/generic.tpl
\family default
 and copy some of its template definitions over to 
\family typewriter
/www/athomaris/demo_basic/lang/generic/generic.tpl
\family default
.
 There you may modify the HTML code (details on the template syntax, macro
 substitutions, hooks are in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Templates"

\end_inset

).
 After having done that, you must restart the template compiler via the
 following URL:
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Template-Compiler"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/demo_basic/translate_tpl.php
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When run successfully, it translates all the templates to PHP code which
 you can find in 
\family typewriter
compiled/generic_generic.php
\family default
.
 This code does not aim to be readable, but is very fast on execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
New Projects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to start a new project is by copying one of the demo projects
 (or any other project) to a new subdirectory.
 For example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
cd /www/athomaris/; sudo cp -a demo_business myproject
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to use the 
\family typewriter
-a
\family default
 flag as 
\family typewriter
root
\family default
, in order to keep some symlinks intact and to ensure that the subdirectory
 
\family typewriter
compiled/
\family default
 remains owned by the Apache user and is writeable by it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afterwards, you should configure Apache such that your new directory is
 accessible via HTTP over some URL.
 For example, add the following to 
\family typewriter
httpd.conf
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Alias /myproject "/www/athomaris/myproject"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't forget to restart Apache after that! You should be able to access
 the new project over the following URLs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/myproject/create_schema.php
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/myproject/translate_tpl.php
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/myproject/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always with PHP projects, you may add any new files and subdiretories
 as you like.
 To ease your life as a developer, most of your work can be delegated to
 the Athomaris PHP library just by adding the following lines:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
require_once(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

config.php
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
require_once(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

$BASEDIR/../common/app.php
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and calling only a few functions.
 Details are explained later.
 If you want to learn how the default page layout works, inspect 
\family typewriter
common/generic.php
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter

\begin_layout Section
Basic 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
 configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subdirectory 
\family typewriter
schema/
\family default
 contains files of the form 
\family typewriter
schema
\emph on
xx
\emph default
.php
\family default
 where 
\family typewriter
\emph on
xx
\family default
\emph default
 must be a number.
 The only purpose of these files is to define different versions of 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
$EXTRA
\family default
.
 In this section, only 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
 is explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
 is a nested PHP structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The outmost level of $SCHEMA is a PHP hash indexed by 
\emph on
table names
\emph default
, obeying standard identifier syntax.
 All table names in the system must be globally unique.
 By default, the PHP table name is also used as SQL table name.
 This default association can be overridden via the 
\family typewriter
SQLNAME
\family default
 attribute (see later).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Table Definitions in 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Table-Definitions-in-$SCHEMA"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each table is described by a nested PHP hash which may contain some of the
 following attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
FIELDS
\family default
 => 
\emph on
hash
\emph default
 describing the database columns.
 No default.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This sub-structure is described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:FIELDS"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
TEMPORAL
\family default
 => 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
 Defaults to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 when omitted.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When a table is created as a temporal table, some special 
\family typewriter
FIELD
\family default
s are automatically added by default.
 Details are described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Temporal-tables"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When 
\family typewriter
TEMPORAL
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, no 
\family typewriter
FIELD
\family default
s are automatically added, not even the default primary key 
\family typewriter
\emph on
tablename
\emph default
_id
\family default
.
 Thus you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 create that explicitly, and you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 add a 
\family typewriter
PRIMARY
\family default
 definition (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
PRIMARY
\family default
 => 
\emph on
string
\emph default
.
 Name of the primary key.
 Defaults to 
\family typewriter
\emph on
singulartablename
\emph default
_id
\family default
 when omitted.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Normally this attribute is determined by default.
 When 
\family typewriter
TEMPORAL
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, or when interfacing with external databases having different schema convention
s, you can set a different name here.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Hint
\series default
: recommended 
\emph on
best practice
\emph default
 is to use the default only as a 
\emph on
hidden
\emph default
 primary key.
 This means that the 
\emph on
end
\emph default
-user should never use its value for any purpose; he/she should not even
 
\emph on
see
\emph default
 this value.
 Instead, the end-user should only see and use 
\family typewriter
UNIQUE
\family default
 keys as described below.
 This has tremendous advantages: defining the user-visible identification
 attributes as 
\emph on
dependent attributes
\emph default
 allows to change them at runtime.
 When combined with 
\family typewriter
REFERENCES
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

on update cascade
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 (see below), your system becomes flexible in a way which is 
\emph on
vital
\emph default
 for large enterprises.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Exception
\series default
 when interfacing to external databases: if you don't have control over
 the schema (e.g.
 when connecting to 
\emph on
existing
\emph default
 databases), you can also specify a 
\emph on
combined key
\emph default
 by enumerating the column names separated with comma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
DB
\family default
 => 
\emph on
string
\emph default
.
 References a database name from 
\family typewriter
$CONFIG
\family default
.
 When omitted, it defaults to the first entry in 
\family typewriter
$CONFIG
\family default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Use this when you maintain multiple database connections in parallel.
 Details on $CONFIG are in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:$CONFIG-configuration"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
ENGINE
\family default
 => 
\emph on
string
\emph default
.
 Only used for MySQL.
 Defaults to 
\family typewriter
MyISAM
\family default
 when omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
UNIQUE
\family default
 => 
\emph on
array
\emph default
 of strings.
 Names of secondary keys.
 No default.
 Can be omitted.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Tells which columns or column combinations should be uniquely indexed.
 If you want to create a combined index, just use a string where the column
 names are comma-separated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
INDEX
\family default
 => 
\emph on
array
\emph default
 of strings.
 Names of indexes.
 No default.
 Can be omitted.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Works like 
\family typewriter

The physical table name as used by the backend database may differ from

 By widely using this feature, you may ease

The

Athomaris convention

 In contrast, column names should always start with the corresponding singular

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here are some excpetions which don't

logically belong
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to some given table:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign keys (see 
\family typewriter
REFERENCES
\family default
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:FIELDS"

\end_inset

): please use the name from the referenced table.
 This way, almost all possible joins can be expressed as 
\emph on
natural joins
\emph default
, and the schema is self-documenting for humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anything which references to external information, such as filesystem data.
 This way, you explicitly express that the corresponding 
\emph on
domain
\emph default
 is not under your control.
 If you have many such cases, it is wise to even introduce some systematics
 for that.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to that table.
 This way, (generated) SQL code becomes better understandable for humans
 (and foreign code bypassing the Athomaris PHP library becomes more intuitive).
 For example, table 
\family typewriter
foos
\family default
 uses column names such 
\family typewriter
foo_id
\family default
 (here as the primary key).
 Because there are some linguistic exceptions in English (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), you can set the singular form here.
 The singular is used as a basis for automatic creation of column names,
 such as 
\family typewriter
*_id
\family default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, when interfacing to external / existing databases, you often have
 to obey foreign conventions conflicting with the default systematics of
 Athomaris.
 In such a case, you can use the following directives for further fine-grained
 control (the meaning of most of them is described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Temporal-tables"

\end_inset

):

\begin_layout Standard
When defining a table 
\family typewriter

\family default
 as temporal, there will be two tables created behind the scenes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foos
\family default
 is a SQL view providing the non-temporal view on the table.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non-temporal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that you cannot access old versions of a tuple, just as with ordinary
 flat SQL tables where old values are always overwritten by updates.
 From a user's perspective, this has (almost) the same semantics as a usual
 SQL table, as if there were no temporal extensions at all.
 The only exception is updating: a drawback of MySQL is that it does not
 allow updates to most views.
 Therefore you must use 
\family typewriter
foos_tp
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
foos
\family default
 for updates if you want to bypass the default programming interface with
 your own hand-written SQL code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
foos_tp
\family default
 is the actual table where all the temporal history is stored.
 When a tuple is 
\emph on
logically updated
\emph default
 (e.g.
 via 
\family typewriter
db_update()
\family default
 c.f.
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Programmers-API-Database"

\end_inset

), a 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 tuple is 
\emph on
inserted
\emph default
 into foos_tp behind the scenes instead (aka COW = Copy On Update strategy).
 The new tuple has the same 
\family typewriter
foo_id
\family default
, but a newer 
\family typewriter
foo_version
\family default
 timestamp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relation between 
\family typewriter
foos_tp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
foos
\family default
 is illustrated by the following SQL code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
create view foos as
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  select * from foos_tp t1 where t1.foo_version in
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    (select max(t2.foo_version) from foos_tp t2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
     where t1.foo_id = t2.foo_id and not t1.foo_deleted
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    );
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 This is handy for startup tasks such as creating initial profiles and users.
 If you omit initial data for tables

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
$INITDATA

 is a hash, indexed by table names.
 Each table is associated an array of records.
 In turn, each record is a hash which associates field names to field values.
\end_layout

Views
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Athomaris can create and manage SQL views in

 Views may be built upon arbitrary queries, which may join multiple tables
 as described in sections

LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Full-Subqueries"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 A View may be used like any other table, but with some restrictions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Views must not span tables from different $CONFIG hosts (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:$CONFIG-configuration"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Views are only readable (equivalent to 
\family typewriter
ACCESS => 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no primary key (equivalent to 
\family typewriter
PRIMARY => null
\family default
).
 As a consequence, no 
\family typewriter
REFERENCES
\family default
 to views are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A view cannot reference to the temporal version of another table, but only
 to the flat one.
 Instead of 
\family typewriter
\emph on

\emph default
_tp,
\family default
 always 
\family typewriter
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A View may reference other views, provided that referenced views occur 
\emph on

\emph default
 in 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA

 This way, cyclic forward-references are impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
The variable

 It is a hash with the following components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

When set, the whole system works with profile-based user authentication
 and authorization.
 The following tables are automatically added to 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

 A temporal table describing the access rights for a class of users.
 This table contains the following columns:
\end_layout

 for each other table in the system.
 It specifies the access rights to the respective table in the same format
 as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 The difference to the specification in $SCHEMA is that here we define

 It contains the following columns:
\end_layout

\family default
 The secondary key uniquely describing the interface style.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 When someone hacks your

 Instead, when you omit these parameters here, the login credentials from
 the Apache authentification is used as database access credentials at runtime.
 Many system designers try to avoid the overhead of maintaining database
 access rights for individual users.
 The Athomaris PHP Library 
\emph on
automates
\emph default
 this task: Whenever an entry in

\family default
 is created or updated via 
\family typewriter
db_insert()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
db_update()
\family default
, the database acess rights (e.g.
 in MySQL this is the global table

\family default
) are automatically updated 
\emph on
in sync
\emph default
 with that.
 This works even when a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

When using master/slave replication in MySQL, you can provide a list of
 slave servers.
 
\emph on
Readonly

 accesses are directed to (randomly selected) servers from the list, in

 This way, the overall system load can be spread more smoothly.
 This is important in environments dominated by database reads.
 This feature is crucial for enterprise-grade scalability.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, each page starts with links to all tables from $SCHEMA.
 You can customize these and add your own links as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define a global variable $LINKS (best practice: do this in 
\family typewriter
config.php
\family default
) which is a hash indexed by categories.
 Each category will later be displayed in a different line.
 The default links are all in the default category 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tables:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
.
 In turn, a link category is another hash indexed by 
\emph on
link names
\emph default
 (see 
\family typewriter
{textlist}
\family default
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Templates"

\end_inset

).
 In the default links, the link name is equal to the table name; in general
 you may create you own names as you like.
 Each link name may be associated with an arbitrary HTML href.
 For example, the default links for project 
\family typewriter
demo_basic
\family default
 are constructed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/demo_basic/index.php?table=foos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: if you want to remove some of the default links, just define something
 like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
$LINKS[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tables:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

][
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, by defining a non-empty string you can redirect it so something
 else.
 The whole default category 
\family typewriter
Tables:
\family default
 can be removed by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
$LINKS[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tables:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that 
\family typewriter
undef($LINKS[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tables:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

])
\family default
 will not work because it is equivalent to non-defining 
\family typewriter
$LINKS
\family default
 at all, which triggers the default link creation.
 When you remove the default category, you should provide 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 links by hand, otherwise your application would be completely link-less.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following request parameters are used by the above functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["table"]

 The table name we are currently working on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["order"]
\family default
 Only for 
\family typewriter
app_display_table()
\family default

 Specifies a comma-separated list of field names for ordering of the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["primary"]
\family default
 Tells which fields are identifying the tuple for 
\family typewriter
app_display_record()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
app_display_download()
\family default
.
 This must be comma-separated list of field names.
 You may specify

any
\emph default
 fields which can 
\emph on
together
\emph default
 uniquely identify the tuple - it need not be the primary key, but can also
 be an

\family default
 key.
 In addition, you also have to supply field values for these fields.
 For example, if you specified 
\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["table"]=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

foos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["primary"]=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

foo_id
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
, you also have to supply 
\family typewriter
$_REQUEST[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foo_id
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]
\family default
 in order to uniquely identify the tuple you want to work with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["delete"]
\family default
 When set, this is a delete request.
 The tuple is 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 identified by its primary key.
 Values for the primary key must also be submitted as additional 
\family typewriter
$_REQUEST
\family default
 fields.
 For example, if table

\family default
 has primary key 
\family typewriter
foo_id
\family default
, the value of 
\family typewriter
$_REQUEST[
\begin_inset Quotes eld

foo_id
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]
\family default
 must be supplied to uniquely identify the record which should be deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["change"]
\family default
 When set, this is a change request for an existing tuple.
 In addition to values for the obligatory primary key, you can specify as
 many additional fields as you like to change.
 When you 
\emph on
omit
\emph default
 a field, its value is left unchanged (see also 
\family typewriter
db_update()
\family default
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Update-Operations"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["insert"]
\family default
 Like

\family typewriter
db_insert()
\family default
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Update-Operations"

\end_inset

).
 You should provide the values of all fields; when you omit one, the 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT
\family default

 Supplying values for the primary key is useless because it is always initialize
d by 
\family typewriter
auto_increment
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["edit"]
\family default
 Tells 
\family typewriter

 which tuple it should prepare for editing.
 This does not yet alter the tuple, but just generate a form for altering

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
$_REQUEST["clone"]
\family default
 Like

\begin_layout Section
Generic Template Mechanism
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Templates"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates are used to separate the presentation layer from the business
 logic.
 In other frameworks, this is called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Model-View-Controller
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (MVC) architecture.
 While our model is maintained by 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
$EXTRA
\family default
 and the controller is simply the Athomaris PHP Library invoked by Apache,
 views (in that terminology) are implemented via our templates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates reside in ASCII files having the extension 
\family typewriter
.tpl
\family default
.
 The template compiler (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Template-Compiler"

\end_inset

) finds all files with that extension and translates them into fast PHP
 code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the outermost level, a template file can contain the following elements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
{include
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
filename
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

/}
\family default
 Includes another file as if its contents were written at the insertion
 point.
 After that, you may 
\emph on
redefine
\emph default
 any templates or textlists.
 Since redefinitions replace the previous definition, you can easily create
 variants of template sets this way.
 In particular, new 
\emph on
skins
\emph default
 can be created rather quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
{textlist}...{/textlist}
\family default
 The content at 
\family typewriter
...

\family default
 must be a sequence of ASCII lines, each terminated by a newline.
 Each line defines a simple macro via the following syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\emph on
name
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

substitution_text
\family default
 The usage of simple macros is explained later (see element 
\family typewriter
{text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
name
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

}
\family default
).
 Example: change the default link-header category 
\family typewriter
Tables:
\family default

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

}
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
{/template}
\family default
.
 The text may contain further directives and macro expansions (working on
 the parameter 
\family typewriter
$data
\family default
) as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
{$
\emph on
var
\emph default

\family default
 Output the PHP parameter 
\family typewriter
$data[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
var
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]
\family default
, as provided to the template invocation.
 If the substitution text contains any HTML special characters, they are
 quoted to avoid XSS attacks onto your system.
 Deeper levels of the 
\family typewriter
$data
\family default
 structure may be accessed via the syntax 
\family typewriter
{$
\emph on
var
\emph default
->subvar}
\family default
 which outputs 
\family typewriter
$data[
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
var
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

][
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
subvar
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]
\family default
.
 Note that 
\family typewriter
{$
\emph on
var
\emph default
->$
\emph on
subvar
\emph default
}
\family default
 would result in something different: 
\family typewriter
$data[
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
var
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

][$data[
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
subvar
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

]]
\family default
.
 As a simple rule of thumb, just remember that the number of 
\family typewriter
$
\family default
 signs in your code indicates nothing more but the number of substitutions
 carried out at runtime.

\family default

 If 
\family typewriter
\emph on

\family default
\emph default
 does not exist anywhere, its name is outputted unmodified in place of the
 non-existing definition (fallback).
 Note there is no quote-protection against HTML code, because the 
\family typewriter
{textlist}
\family default
 should have been written by a trusted programmer who probably even 
\emph on

\emph default
 to include raw HTML code for his purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\family typewriter
$data[

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\family default
.
 The same principle applies orthogonally to all examples where a string
 in double quotes is used: instead of the string constant, you may always
 use a variable instead, or vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\family default
, but the text is written in typewriter font (monospaced), blanks are translated
 to 
\family typewriter
&nbsp;
\family default

\family typewriter
<br/>
\family default
.
 This way, a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Handy for displaying raw computer data which should be protected from HTML
 interpretation.

\family default
, but when the text is very long, it is abbreviated with 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most business process langugages such as BPEL follow a 
\emph on
procedural
\emph default
 paradigm for describing a workflow, similar to classical procedural programming
 languages.
 These models are extremely complex: the current WS-BPEL specification 2.0
 prints to 140 pages DINA4 in very small font.
 In contrast, the Athomaris engine tries to remain simple, but to reach
 at least the same 
\emph on
expressive power
\emph default
.
 In future releases, we want to implement translators from BPEL to our model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Athomaris business process engine uses the well-known concept of 
\series bold
finite automatons
\series default
 as established in computer science for decades.
 The most important difference to the theoretical concept is 
\series bold
explicit state
\series default
: 
\emph on
automatic instantiation
\emph default
 of new automatons, as soon as a new tuple is added to the database.
 In other words: a new finite automaton is instantiated automatically for
 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 tuple of the database (whether it be a newly inserted tuple, or a previously
 modified tuple), working on that tuple independently from other automatons.
 The only triggering condition is that some 
\emph on
rule
\emph default
 must match on that tuple.
 Thanks to implicitly matching 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 existing tuple, the system can achieve almost arbitrary parallelism and
 scalability.
 If you want a purely sequential workflow, just don't produce 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 tuples which would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

watched
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the Athomaris engine - instead just update the explicit state which
 is kept inside your 
\emph on
old
\emph default
 tuple.
 Another benefit of explicit state is that other applications can query
 and work with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Athomaris model is much more similar to a rule-based computation paradigm
 called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blackboard systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Another similar model is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coordination models and languages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which has attracted a lot of research some years ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a small comparison of concepts between procedural models like BPEL
 and our non-procedural

\begin_layout Standard
The business process engine is enabled by

USE_BUSINESS_ENGINE => true
\family default
 in 
\family typewriter
$CONFIG
\family default
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:$CONFIG-configuration"

\end_inset

).
 This adds some orchestration tables to $SCHEMA as described in the next
 section.
 After you have filled those tables which orchestration rules or have updated
 them, you have to invoke the orchestration compiler via the following URL:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
http://localhost/demo_business/orchestrator.php
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a future release of Athomaris, we want to have a graphical tool under
 this URL where you can view and create orchestrations, probably even with
 drag and drop.
 For now, there is only a batchmode compiler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When compilation is successful, a file 
\family typewriter
compiled/engine_table.php
\family default
 is created.
 Afterwards, you may invoke the business process engine from the commandline

\emph default
 a valid column name therein.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Currently not yet implemented: if you leave this field empty, a kind of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 will be executed.
 State is choosen automatically, but the business process needs to be

\emph default
.

\family typewriter
bp_outputs 
\family default
Not yet implemented.
 In future releases, this will be used for argument checking when calling
 procedural-style business processes and sub-processes.
 Leave it empty for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
bp_joinwith
\family default
 Usually left empty.
 When you specify a comma-separated list of other table names, these tables
 will be naturally joined with 
\family typewriter
\emph on
tablename
\family default
\emph default
.
 In consequence, you may use their fields in 
\family typewriter
@{
\emph on
otherfield
\emph default
}
\family default
 macros (see below).
 This way you can easily access related data.

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rules
\family default
 This table describes the left-hand part of an automaton rule.
 In addition to the usual temporal columns such as 
\family typewriter
rule_id
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
rule_version
\family default
, it consists of the following columns:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
bp_name
\family default
 References 
\family typewriter
bps
\family default
.
 Tells to which business process the current rule belongs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_prio
\family default
 This is used to define an 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 on all rules working for the same business process.
 In other words, the combined secondary key of 
\family typewriter
rules
\family default
 is defined as 
\family typewriter
UNIQUE => array(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bp_name,rule_prio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_startvalue
\family default
 Defines which value a 
\emph on
cell candidate
\emph default
 must have if this rule shall 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Once the rule has fired on a candidate, the execution engine remembers
 the identity of the firing cell (in the following, we mean this single
 instance when we speak of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 In order to allow multiple modes of testing and matching against cell candidate
s, the following syntax must be used:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
=
\emph on
value
\family default
\emph default
 Tests the candidate for equality with the given constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
%
\emph on
value
\family default
\emph default
 Matches if 
\family typewriter
\emph on
value
\family default
\emph default
 is a substring of the candidate cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
/
\emph on
regex
\emph default
/
\family default
 Matches 
\family typewriter
\emph on
regex
\family default
\emph default
 against the candidate cell.
 You can use Perl-compatible regular expressions with parentheses.
 Later these may be used for 
\family typewriter
@{
\emph on
n
\emph default
}
\family default
 macro substitutions (see 
\family typewriter
rule_action
\family default
 below).
 Note that full-line matches must be indiated by 
\family typewriter
/
\backslash
A...
\backslash
Z/
\family default
 or similar.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_condition
\family default
 Defines additional conditions which must hold if the rule shall fire.
 The syntax is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\emph on
<empty>
\emph default
 When left empty, the condition is always true, i.e.
 there is no additional condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
?
\emph on
fieldname
\emph default
=
\emph on
value
\family default
\emph default
 Similar to 
\family typewriter
rule_startvalue
\family default
, but you may test arbitrary other fields.
 If you have used natural joins at 
\family typewriter
bp_joinwith
\family default
, you can use them here.
 This is very useful for formulating complex 
\family typewriter
rule_condition
\family default
s.
 You may denote the same variants of tests as with 
\family typewriter
rule_fieldvalue
\family default
, for example 
\family typewriter
?
\emph on
fieldname
\emph default
%
\emph on
value
\family default
\emph default
 or 
\family typewriter
?
\emph on
fieldname
\emph default
/
\emph on
regex
\emph default
/
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may specify multiple conditions on different lines; these are logically
 anded together.
 In a future release, we plan to support full-fledged boolean expressions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_location
\family default
 Not yet implemented.
 This will specify the hostname or a group of hostnames where the rule should
 be executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_firevalue
\family default
 As soon as the rule fires, this value will be immediately written to the
 cell.
 This is used for proper restarting in case of system crashes.
 It simply records the fact that a rule has fired and thus an action has
 started (and probably must be rolled back).
 You may provide one of the following syntaxes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\emph on
<empty>
\emph default
 When left empty, a reasonable default is written into the cell.
 If the cell contained an integer number, this number is incremented by
 1.
 If it contained a string, the string is 
\emph on
pre
\emph default
pended with 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

start_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
.
 Recommendation: don't use the default, always specify this value explicitly!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
+
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\emph on
n
\family default
\emph default
 When starting with a plus sign followed by a blank and a number, this number
 is added to the old cell contents.
 Works only well if the cell had an integer type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
<anything
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

else>
\emph default
 Will be literally copied to the cell.
 However, it may contain 
\family typewriter
@
\family default
 macros, which are 
\emph on
substituted
\emph default
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
@{
\emph on
fieldname
\emph default
}
\family default
 This is substituted by the value of 
\family typewriter
\emph on
fieldname
\family default
\emph default
.
 It may stem from the matching tuple, or even from a more complex join delivered
 by 
\family typewriter
bp_joinwith
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
@{
\emph on
n
\emph default
}
\family default
 When 
\family typewriter
\emph on
n
\family default
\emph default
 is a number, it is substituted by the 
\family typewriter
\emph on
n
\family default
\emph default
-th matching parenthesis of the regular expression denoted in 
\family typewriter
rule_startvalue
\family default
.
 This way, you can build your own parser and propagate almost arbitrary
 values from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
@(
\emph on
subcommand
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

args...
\emph default
)
\family default
 This is substituted with the standard output of 
\family typewriter
\emph on
subcommand
\family default
\emph default
, executed in a subshell.
 For example, you may do simple calculations such as 
\family typewriter
@(expr @{foo_state} + 1)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_action
\family default
 Tells what to do when the rule fires.
 The following kinds of actions are currently implemented (further actions
 such as SOAP are planned):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
script
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\emph on
command
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\emph on
args
\emph default
...

\family default
 Executes the given command with parameters in a Unix shell.
 Inside your text, you may use the same macro substitutions as explained
 earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
url
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

http://...

\family default
 This is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
script wget -O - 'http://...'
\family default
.
 You can query arbitrary web or ftp servers this way.
 When combined with the macro features explained above, you may easily create
 arbitrary REST queries, just for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\end_inset

fieldname2='
\emph default

\family default
 Inserts a new tuple into the database.
 Notice: when some (other) rules are defined for this table, this effectively
 results in creating a new non-procedural sub-business-process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

fieldname2='
\emph default

\family default
 Same, but update a tuple from 
\family typewriter
\emph on

\family default
\emph default
.
 When 
\family typewriter
\emph on
tablename
\family default
\emph default
 is mentioned in 
\family typewriter
bp_joinwith
\family default
, you need not supply the primary key because it can be determined automatically.
 Otherwise, the primary key of the tuple must be explicitly given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\emph on
tablename
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\emph on
fieldname1='value1'
\emph default
...

\family default
 As the name suggests, a tuple is deleted from the database.
 The primary key must be always given.
 Be careful with it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple actions may be supplied if they are on different lines.
 They will be executed sequentially.
 Note that a failing action (such as a database error) will immediately
 terminate the action chain - the following actions will not be started
 in such a case.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
rule_timeout
\family default
 When non-zero, each started business process is monitored.
 Whenever it does not respond either on 
\family typewriter
stdout
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
stderr
\family default
 within the given timeout (measured in seconds), a pseudo-event 
\family typewriter
TIMEOUT
\family default
 is generated (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pseudo-Events"

\end_inset

).
 The pseudo-event can then be handled as described below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
cont_prio
\family default
 This is used to define an order on all continuations which are 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
cont_match
\family default
 Regular expression which matches

\emph default
 from 
\family typewriter
stdout
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\family default
 of the 
\family typewriter
rule_action

\family default
\emph default
 (see section

).
 When the regular expression matches, the continuation is 
\emph on
selected
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
cont_action
\family default
 Same syntax as described at 
\family typewriter
rule_action
\family default
.
 Although it is possible to start another scripts again, their output is
 not parsed again.
 So use this only for small actions not involving different state changes
 at the cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
cont_endvalue
\family default
 After this cont has been selected and the 
\family typewriter
cont_action
\family default
 has sucessfully completed, this value is written back into the cell.
 Used to record the fact that the action has completed.
 When you leave this empty, no value is written and the next continuation
 according to 
\family typewriter
cont_prio
\family default
 is examined whether this can be selected (continue the candidate selection
 process).
 When non-empty, you may use the

\begin_layout Standard
All database operations use a common PHP representation for table data,
 called 
\family typewriter
$data
\family default
.
 It is simply an 
\emph on
array of records
\emph default
.
 A record is simply a hash, indexed by the column names.
 For example:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, the column names are 
\emph on
deliberatly
\emph default
 repeated.
 Although OO classes 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 save 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of that runtime space overhead 
\emph on
in theory
\emph default
, maintaining OO class definitions instead would be a greater effort, and
 it would lower flexibility.
 In particular, 
\family typewriter
ACCESS => 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

n
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Table-Definitions-in-$SCHEMA"

\end_inset

) will omit inacessible fields 
\emph on
dynamically at runtime
\emph default
, individually for each field.
 Another use is for 
\family typewriter
db_update()
\family default
, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Update-Operations"

\end_inset

: There you can simply specify 
\emph on
which
\emph default
 fields to update, just by omitting all those fields you don't want to change.
 Note that in absence of database transactions, this has different 
\emph on
atomic properties
\emph default
 from first reading a full tuple, updating the PHP structure, and finally
 writing back the full tuple.
 The difference becomes clear with MySQL MyISAM tables in presence of 
\emph on
concurrent
\emph default
 updating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of flexibility is hardly to achieve with the usually static OO
 class concepts.
 Thus we use a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 programming style (inspired by languages like ML, Haskell or good old Lisp),
 and we pay some (acceptable) runtime space overhead in favor of a simple
 design.
 Nevertheless, future releases of the Athomaris PHP library could support
 automatic generation of class definitions from 
\family typewriter
$SCHEMA
